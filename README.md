## What it can do?
- Telling the time at any city or timezone in the world
- Converting a time to another timezone
- Displaying info about the sun (sunset, sunrise, solar noon...)

See the wiki for reference.

## Getting your own install

ailotime runs on Python 3.6.

- Place all these files in a folder
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies
- Get a bot token on Discord API and write it in `run.py`
- Execute `run.py` ; after some loading, the bot should be up and running.

## Invite

I am providing a link for inviting ailotime. However, I am hosting it on my (small) server, so if someday the bot becomes too popular, I will maybe not be able to handle it.

[Click here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=466678005926723584&scope=bot&permissions=2048 "Click here") to invite ailotime on your Discord server!
